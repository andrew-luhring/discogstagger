# discogstagger

## What is it

discogstagger is a console based audio meta-data tagger. Artist profile data is 
retrieved via the discogs.com API.

Simply provide the script with a destination directory name, that contains an
album consisting of either FLAC or MP3 media files and the discogs.com 
release-id. discogstagger calls out to the discogs.com API and updates the
audio meta-data accordingly.

If no release-id is given, the application checks, if a file "id.txt" exists
(the name of this file can be configured in the configuration) and if this file
contains a specific property (id_tag). If both is true the release-id from this
file is used. This is useful for batch processing.

During the process, all album images (if present) are retrieved from the API. 
As well, a play-list (.m3u) and an information file (.nfo) are generated per
each release.

Optionally discogstagger will embed the found album art into the file meta data

## Requirements

* Mutagen 
* discogs-client 
* requests

I am also packaging/reusing the MediaFile library from the "beets" project. This
will be packaged with discogs tagger until MediaFile is split out to its own
package.

## Installation 

Fetch the repo from github
```
git clone https://github.com/jesseward/discogstagger.git
```

Install the script requirements
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run through set-up script
```
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Configuration 

DiscogsTagger searches for the configuration file at the default location of
~/.config/discogstagger/discogs_tagger.conf, at run-time. Or you're able to specify the config 
location with the '-c' switch.

The configuration file must be present to execute the script. The default 
settings (as shipped), should work without any modifications.

Note that you may wish to modify the following default configuration options. 
The defaults are shipped as such in attempt to be as non destructive as possible

```
# True/False : leaves a copy of the original audio files on disk, untouched after 
keep_original=True
# Embed cover art. Include album art from discogs.com in the metadata tags
embed_coverart=False
```

To specify genre in your tags, review the use_style option. With use_style
set to True, you're instructing discogstagger to pull the "Style" field. The style field
is typically more genre specific than the discogs "Genre" field. In the example below (40522),
with use_style=True, the genre field is tagged as "House".

```
Use Discogs "style" elements instead of the genre as the genre Meta-Tag in files (True)
Example http://www.discogs.com/Blunted-Dummies-House-For-All/release/40522
Style = House
Genre = Electronic
use_style=True
```

To keep already existing tags, you can include these tags in the configuration as well. 
Usually Rippers (e.g. RubyRipper) do include the freedb_id, which could be kept using
the following configuration. The list of all tags could be taken from the file 
discogstagger/ext/mediafile.py.

```
# Keep the following tags
keep_tags=freedb_id
```

Furthermore you can use lowercase directory and filenames using the following configuration:

```
# Use lowercase filenames
use_lower_filenames=True
```

For batch-mode tagging, it is not necessary anymore to provide the release-id via the
'-r' parameter on the commandline. The same is possible by using a file (by default: id.txt)
with the key/value pair 'discogs_id'. This can be configured in the configuration via the
following parameters as well:

```
[batch]
# if no release id is given, the application checks if a file with the
# name id_file (in this case id.txt) is in the source directory,
# if it is there the id_tag is checked (discogs_id) and assigned to the
# release id
id_file=id.txt
id_tag=discogs_id
```

Please note, that right now there is no error-handling, if there is no '-r' parameter
and no id.txt file. The program will then just exit with an error message.

The command line takes the following parameters:

```
Usage: discogs_tagger.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RELEASEID, --releaseid=RELEASEID
                        The discogs.com release id of the target album
  -s SDIR, --source=SDIR
                        The directory that you wish to tag
  -d DESTDIR, --destination=DESTDIR
                        The (base) directory to copy the tagged files to
  -c CONFFILE, --conf=CONFFILE
                        The discogstagger configuration file.
```
